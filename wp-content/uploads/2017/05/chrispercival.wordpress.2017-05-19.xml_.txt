<h1>Working hard is great, but you also need some time out!</h1>
I'm sure everyone can agree with me on this one? We all work hard and we all need to get away, whether that be on a family holiday, weekend away or simply some time at home, it's just as important as working hard. I can speak from experience on this one and can clearly remember being at University, doing 12 hour Ambulance shifts (as part of my placement) and running a business over 100 miles away... People kept telling me to take some time out, not least my family and it wasn't until they booked a family holiday for me, that I realised just how much I needed to get away for a break.

It is sometime hard to realise that you do need a break, you get so deep into what your doing and keeping up to speed with what's happening, whether you have reached your goals, monthly targets, ongoing projects - the list is endless.

My advice is simple and something I have been doing for the past couple of years - <strong>book breaks in advance!</strong>

... This has reminded me to book some holidays!]]></content:encoded>

		<title>My Day out in a Private Jet</title>

My team and I at <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com">Jigsaw Medical</a> are used to medical repatriations, normally theses are performed for an array of insurance companies and take place in private aircraft or commercial flights with medical escort. However, just a few days after new year the operations team at Jigsaw Medical took a phone call from a private patient who was ill abroad and without travel insurance. The prospective client enquired about our <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com/emergency-ambulance-service.html">medical repatriation</a> services and whether we could help get her home for medical treatment in the UK…

Normally our "Private Jets" are old propeller aircraft specifically used for air repatriations and therefore not really that glamorous... However for this job (due to the lack of insurance) we had to charter a 'normal' private jet from our friends at <a href="http://www.saxonair.com/">Saxon Air.</a>

Obviously, as the 'boss' and a Paramedic myself, it was left to me to carry out this job (along with a colleague Kathryn, who is also a Paramedic). Believe it or not, <strong>it was cheaper to get a private jet</strong> than it would have been to drive by land ambulance.
<h3>In just under 3 hours, our shift on our RRV (or plane) was done and the patient was successfully back in a UK hospital!</h3>]]></content:encoded>

<h3>I for one would love to grow my businesses as quickly as possible... but you can't afford to run out of money...</h3>
This is a question I have asked myself a number of times and have often discussed with my family and friends. The reality is, nobody seems to know the definitive answer but I can say - its a very important factor. I used to not worry about cash flow at all and just deal with it as the issues arose, however our ethos as a business is to pay our bills on time and get paid on time (easier said than done!). I am very lucky to have a supportive family and a supportive bank manager - all of which help when it comes to cash flow.

Growth of a business and its cash flow go hand-in-hand, good businesses grow when they have lots of cash; through investing in their workforce, assets and processes (and of course they stop when they don't have any free cash!). However, not-so-good businesses will pay their shareholders handsomely and not re-invest. <strong>No investment = No growth.</strong>

I will always remember learning my lesson in cash flow, I clearly remember my dad telling me not to buy some new equipment (which was not vital) as I would <em>"run out of money"</em>... and guess what happened. Since then, we keep a close eye on our cash flow in both businesses, our accountant sits in our main office which really helps when it comes to keeping on top of the finances, but best of all Abi (my Sales Manager) sits opposite me and keeps an even closer eye on spending (she is from Yorkshire)!
<h2>So whats the answer?</h2>
Plan to grow when you have plenty of cash in the bank, not when you do not. Be strategic in the growth and <strong><a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/dont-become-busy-fools/">don't become busy fools</a>.</strong>

But what is a busy fool and how can you avoid becoming one of them...</h1>
There are so many opportunities to be a busy fool in today’s business environment, if you can relate to this - perhaps now is a great time to give yourself a shake and set some New Year’s resolutions to ensure you drop the “fool” and just stay busy....
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Saying "YES!"</span></h2>
Richard Branson is known as "Mr Yes" at <a href="http://www.virgin.com/">Virgin</a> and although I agree there is a lot to be said about saying 'Yes' (and I do this myself most of the time), you also need to know when to say NO! This is more relevent when it comes to business and I can best relate to this in our work with Jigsaw Medical and <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com/event-medical-cover.html">event medical cover</a>. The event cover industry is full of 'cheap and cheerful companies' which we do not compete with at Jigsaw Medical, we stick to what we are good at - at the higher end of the spectrum, motor sport, festivals and the like. We used to say Yes to everyone - and guess what we became...
<h3>... Make sure you find your niche and stick to it.</h3>]]></content:encoded>

The internet?</h1>
Companies large and small are getting used to fact that you <strong>need</strong> to have a web site. But just having a web site doesn't guarantee a company an increase in business--if those millions of potential customers don't happen to stumble on it, you're spinning your virtual wheels... Obviously with <a href="http://www.ejigsaw.co.uk">eJigsaw</a> you will have gathered that I love the internet and realising its potential to our businesses. Although I am a believer that businesses can survive without a website, its only a small number of sectors where this is possible. The recent Google advert very powerfully re-enforced the power of the internet and a fantastic <a href="http://www.ejigsaw.co.uk/website-design-chester/">website design</a>.
<h2>The search engines</h2>
Those of you who know what we do at eJigsaw and what has partially made the success of Jigsaw Medical so far is that we have some very powerful search engine marketing, which is all ethical, organic and in-house. For example, our Jigsaw Medical website is optimised by our friends at eJigsaw for many search terms, including <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com">first aid training</a>. When we talk about businesses surviving without an internet presence, I strongly feel that without our websites, social media and range of internet marketing streams - we would not be where we are today.
<h2>What do you need to see a return from your online investment?</h2>
Obviously we would be bias in who you should use to provide this service to your business, because I think the team at eJigsaw would take some beating! But from a personal point of view, you need to look at building your online presence by using the following tips!
<ol>
	<li><strong>A great website design - </strong>This is the fundamental part of your internet presence, its your online office, just think of it as your house, but online.</li>
	<li><strong>Search engine marketing</strong> - Once you have a great website for your business, it needs to be found by these millions of potential customers, having a great SEO company will help you get found on Google and other search engines.</li>
	<li><strong>Branding -</strong> Your website and everything you do should be focused around your brand!</li>
	<li><strong>Social Media -</strong> You need to be on Twitter, Facebook Business and Google + (at the least)</li>
	<li><strong>Active Blog</strong> - Make sure you have an active blog which is interesting (unlike mine) and provides a growth in your website content.</li>
	<li><strong>DELEGATE</strong> - Do not spend to much time trying to do this yourself - Hire <a href="http://www.ejigsaw.co.uk/">eJigsaw</a>!</li>
</ol>]]></content:encoded>

<h2><a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/person-with-question-mark-backgrounds-wallpapers.jpg"><img class="wp-image-431 alignleft" alt="person-with-question-mark-backgrounds-wallpapers" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/02/person-with-question-mark-backgrounds-wallpapers-300x198.jpg" width="300" height="198" /></a></h2>
<h2>Getting the right people, at the right time, into the right positions within your organisation, is critical to it's success...</h2>
I am strong believer that it is the people who make a business good, or bad. I recently made one of our suppliers an ex-supplier, as I felt their customer service ethos was not in line with what we expect as a customer, but I also didn't want them to be an instrumental part of our business. In the same token, because it's the people who make your business, it's also the people who make (or break) theirs. In my view suppliers and customers should be treated in the same way, we need both of them to provide an excellent service to our clients, if someone in their business letting that down - we would go elsewhere. The same can be said for our businesses, if <em>people</em> don't like our <em>people</em>, this will reflect badly on our business - however good we may be.... <strong>you might be getting the drift about the whole 'people' thing!</strong>
<h2>Customer service</h2>
<strong>Not everyone will be great at dealing with customers</strong>, <strong>but that's okay providing that is not their role!</strong><strong> </strong>Getting the right people in the right place is the aim of the game, those who are customer facing should be organised, approachable, problem solving and have a passion for great customer service. For example, in <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com">Jigsaw Medical</a> our clinicains need to be skilled, professional and naturally caring, but also our design team in <a href="http://www.ejigsaw.co.uk/">eJigsaw</a> also need to be skilled, professional and caring. Lots of core attributes will transfer over - whatever the role!

<h2>How to get the right people...</h2>
Now there is a question... I'm confident that nobody would actually know the answer to this one (I'm just 22 but have already had to "restructure" one of my organisation's to ensure we maintained the right people, in the right places).... But here are some top-tips!
<ul>
	<li><strong>Use a professional HR company</strong> to help with the nitty gritty - we use <a href="https://www.peninsula-online.com/">Peninsula Business Services </a>in all of our businesses, they are friendly, realistic and professional</li>
	<li><strong>Use Psychometric profiling</strong> to uncover the 'real' person behind the interview - we use <a href="http://yenomassociates.co.uk/">Yenom Associates</a> for all of our Occupational Personality Profiling (OPP)</li>
	<li><strong>Take your time</strong> in choosing the right person, they may not be the first person you meet or interview, but they may be filling in your online application!</li>
	<li><strong>Don't use recruitment agencies </strong>for permanent positions - there are some exceptions to this rule, but generally <strong>you</strong> know who you want on <strong>your</strong> <strong>team</strong>!</li>
</ul>
<h2>Remember! The people you employ will almost certainly be the difference between success, and failure... but also the difference between an energetic and positive working life - or a hard one!</h2>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Concentrate on your business, not your competitors</title>

<h1>If you concentrate more on what your competitors are doing, your own business will <span style="text-decoration: underline;">fail</span>.</h1>
<h3>... A bold claim, but one which I genuinely do believe in.</h3>
There is a small flip side to this which is that it is important to know what they are doing, but like everything - there is a limit to how much snooping you need to do! I am fairly confident I <strong>know</strong> exactly what our competitors in <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com">Jigsaw Medical</a> and <a href="http://www.ejigsaw.co.uk/">eJigsaw</a> are doing, but I do not spend time <strong>concentrating</strong> on what they are doing, or worse, 'spying' on them. This is the important difference which you need to keep an eye on...
<h3>Do you look at your competitors Facebook, website or twitter etc EACH DAY?</h3>
If your answer is yes, then to be brutally honest, you need to have a look at your own Facebook, twitter and concentrate on that! Don't get me wrong, a quarterly look at what they are up to - or even a reactive snoop is not a problem and, like I say, <strong>knowing</strong> what they are up to is important, <strong>concentrating</strong> on them is likely to put your own business onto the path of failure.
<h3>So, what's the problem?</h3>
There are a few problems really, the main one being your lack of focus and effort on your own business - which should worry you. But other issues in concentrating too much on your competitors may also be the decrease in morale for yourself, and your team. By all means if they do something you think is great - make it better, don't copy it and start a 'cat fight' - work with your team, your brand and your business - and make it better!
<h3>How do you know?</h3>
Good question - well I may only be 22 years-old, but already I have learnt this important lesson. I employed a manager in one of our divisions who was fixated on our competitors, he would text me, call me and email me about what they were up to and why... He would create negativity in the team by telling them all about how our competitors are doing this, and that - He was not looking closer to home at what <strong>we</strong> could do to make our service better and ultimately make them suffer. Needless to say, the person in question is no longer in my team..
<h3>And guess what - we focused on us and <em>'kept an eye' on what they were up to</em> -<em><span style="text-decoration: underline;"> not the other way round</span>.</em></h3>
<h3>The end result = We doubled our turnover in that division &amp; lesson learnt!</h3>]]></content:encoded>

You need them.

I am a keen believer in goals and lining up a target, this goes for business and also personally. My business goals come in all shapes and sizes and focus on different aspects of my businesses.
<h2>Tell your team</h2>
Don't forget - if your goal involves your team (which I'm sure it will), you need to share it with them, so they can also focus on helping you reach it!

Don't just keep it to yourself!
<h3>Have a Happy Monday and get some goals set!</h3>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I often see startup businesses and I sometimes think they have missed the point somewhere. Copying an existing business will not work - unless you take the bits they are not doing well at, and make them better in your business.

There are thousands of event medical and first aid training providers in the UK, there are also thousands of design &amp; hosting companies in the UK, so why are we succeeding? We have simply taken what the industry doesn't do very well, and made it 10 times better.

So my Saturday tip is this.... Don't just copy someone else's idea, take the industry by the reins, and <strong>make it better! </strong>

Remember: "it's about being different"]]></content:encoded>

A lot of entrepreneurs know they should be looking into what the cloud can do for their company but aren’t certain of where to begin. If you’re struggling to get your head around what <a href="http://www.ejigsaw.co.uk/cloud-hosting/">cloud computing</a> actually is, then check out our website for <a href="http://www.ejigsaw.co.uk/">eJigsaw</a>....

The market over the next 5 years will change dramatically as the scepticism and concerns over moving to the cloud reduce and more and more people and businesses embrace the technology. Evidence suggests that the global cloud market could reach £150 billion by 2020<strong>.</strong> <strong></strong>

Firstly entrepreneurs need a product that specifically meets their business needs – At eJigsaw we have invested a lot of our resources into creating a great value product that meets the needs of our direct customers, many of whom are entrepreneurs.

<a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cloud-computing-datatrend.jpg"><img class="wp-image-478 alignleft" alt="cloud-computing-datatrend" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/03/cloud-computing-datatrend.jpg" width="223" height="167" /></a>In my businesses, I want to keep overheads down, yet have the right solution to grow my business. In-house IT is extreemly expensive, especially when you are growing. Do you order the £10,000 server for today or the £15,000 as your growing, and may need this capacity tomorrow. Cloud hosting lets easily alter the capacity of your servers to meet the changing needs of your businesses. For instance, businesses with websites on cloud servers can schedule upgrades to cope with peaks in traffic. This ensures sites don’t go down or suffer from poor performance when they’re busy... When was the last time you saw 'Dragons Den' and Googled the company who was pitching, only to find their website was 'down'? It always confuses me (and I do often email them or even Tweet them) to promote our solid hosting services at <a href="http://www.ejigsaw.co.uk">eJigsaw</a>. Its most likely the best advertising they will ever get and nobody can see their website!...
<h3>Hosting is important, not least for entrepreneurs... so get yourself in The eJigsaw Cloud and <a href="http://www.ejigsaw.co.uk/contact">contact</a> my awesome hosting team today and keep your business online!</h3>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>...Okay, this may turn into a slightly controversial post - so I will keep it brief and put it out there...</h2>
<a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/r-ONTARIO-TEACHERS-STRIKE-large570.jpg"><img class="wp-image-482 alignright" alt="r-ONTARIO-TEACHERS-STRIKE-large570" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/r-ONTARIO-TEACHERS-STRIKE-large570.jpg" width="400" height="167" /></a>Does striking get you anywhere? - that's the question!

When I was a student Paramedic, it was clear to me that unions sill very much existed and were campaigning for people to join up (for the record, I didn't as I personally don't believe in them). I am not convinced that striking is the way to be heard, its certainly the way to get some (bad) press and upset the nation, but I don't think its the way to put your point across in modern times.

Most recently we saw teachers strike to get their views heard and whilst I agree with what they are saying, I still feel that people should find an alternative way to get their own way! Putting the education of the nations children at risk by doing it - is probably not the most favored move!
<h3>Whats the alternative?</h3>
If a member of my team were to be upset or even close to thinking about 'striking' I would be upset that they haven't approached me to discuss it... It's a little different in the fact that my team is small compared with the nations teachers! However, there is always someones office door you can knock on to get your opinions heard, without the banner printing costs and disruption!

Striking often results in more harm than good and I think that's whats happened in the latest teaching strike. There’s got to be a better way to get the opinions of both sides heard and resolved, rather than neglecting the education of our young people<strong>.. We are all human after all!</strong> <strong></strong>

		<title>5 Ways to Motivate Your Team</title>
		<link>http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/5-ways-motivate-team/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong><a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/teamwork.png"><img class="size-full wp-image-486 alignright" alt="teamwork" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/teamwork.png" width="434" height="261" /></a>1. Lead with Enthusiasm &amp; Optimism</strong> – Negativity and fear are likely knocking your team off balance and it’s time to regroup, refocus, and unite to create a winning mindset, culture and positive team environment. Now, more than ever, is a time for positive leadership. Now is the time to uplift, encourage and inspire your teams. When your folks talk about the challenges, you talk about the opportunities. When others talk about why they can’t succeed, you give them every reason why they can. So often the difference between success and failure is belief and as a positive leader you need to inspire this belief and optimism in your team.
<p align="left"><strong>2. Don't Just Hide in Your Office</strong> – You need to be humble and hungry. Humble in that you seek to learn, grow, and improve every day, and hungry with a passion to work harder than everyone else. Now is not a time to be barricaded in your office. Now is a time to be in their with your team, leading, working, and building a successful future.</p>
<strong>3. Set Goals &amp; Share Them</strong> – You should have goals, whether they are just a goal for Monday, a goal for the month or a goal further ahead… You need them. I am a keen believer in goals and lining up a target, this goes for business and also personally. My business goals come in all shapes and sizes and focus on different aspects of my businesses. Don’t forget – if your goal involves your team (which it will), you need to share it with them, so they can also focus on helping you reach it!
<p align="left"><strong>4. Share a Positive Vision</strong> – Rally your team around a positive vision for the road ahead. Instead of being disappointed about where you are, decide to be optimistic about where you are going. Vision helps you and your team see the road ahead and it gives you something meaningful and valuable to strive towards. Discuss where you have been, where you are going and why you are going there. Martin Luther King Jr. had a dream/vision and he changed the world with it. Share your dream and improve your organization with it. After all, if you think your best days are behind you, they are. <span style="text-decoration: underline;">If you think your best days are ahead of you, they are.</span></p>
<p align="left"><strong>5. Teach Your Team to Be Heroes, Not Victims</strong> – Heroes and victims get knocked down. The distinction between the two groups lies in the fact that heroes get back up while victims simply give up. Help your team to realise that they are not victims of circumstance. Rather, remind them that they have a high level of control—in other words, they have a significant influence over how things turn out - because they should!. Life is a story, and the story we tell ourselves and the role we play determines the quality and direction of our life. The most successful people and teams are able to overcome adversity by telling themselves a more positive story than the rest.</p>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Starting Out In Business</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/business-plan-xs.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-491 alignright" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/04/business-plan-xs.jpg" alt="Business plan" width="467" height="310" /></a>Instead of waiting for someone else to hire you, why not set up a company and employ yourself?</h2>
It would be reasonable to say that starting your own business is not for everyone... it involves a great deal of hard work and risk, but also a massive potential reward. Many people who are looking at starting their own business really don't know where to begin. There is some guidence on the internet for you, including some help from the government on '<a href="https://www.gov.uk/starting-up-a-business/start-with-an-idea">Starting your own business</a>'.

<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>But here are my four (and a bit) top tips...</strong></span>

<strong>1. A bad time is the right time... </strong>It is tricky to start a business at any time - not just during a recession - but their particular business idea is so niche, so focussed, and so special that they shrug off the gloom and just get on with it. The upside of starting a business during a downturn is that things can only get better as the economic climate improves, and you will have learnt an awful lot in the difficult times that you can use in the easier ones.

<strong>2. The right idea... </strong>For those of you who have seen <a href="http://www.ejigsaw.co.uk/">eJigsaw</a> - "it's about being different". Your idea either needs to be unique or something which is different from your prospective competitors, don't just copy someone else - do a better job!

<strong>3. The tools... </strong>Most homes and most students are already equipped with quite a lot of the tools any business needs to reach a worldwide audience from day one. Computer power is so cheap that many school or university leavers have their own machines, with processing power unimaginable a few years ago. Laptops can edit sound or movies, design software, and keep track of all the details of a start-up business at minimal cost. Internet connectivity allows a start-up entrepreneur to collaborate with video conferencing at almost no cost, an extraordinary breakthrough.

<strong>4. The people... </strong>Okay, it will not matter immediately (unless you are employing someone immediately) - but don't forget that people make a massive difference to your business and its success. Have the right people in your team and work with the best suppliers and support networks to make it easier for you and better for you business!

<strong>... OH! And don't forget 'cash is king', make sure you keep an eye on that cash flow! Have a look at my blog on <a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/fast-grow-business/">'how quick should you grow your business'</a>

		<title>A Big Milestone...</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I recently hit a big milestone in my journey so far, something which I didn't see happening so quickly...

I was once told that there 'was no money in our industry', I was told this by a chap who ended up selling me his business - and in the year following our acquisition we managed to double its revenue... I suppose that alone refuted his comment and made me more confident than ever that there was huge potential for a professional and forward thinking business in the sector.

Recently however we have reached this milestone which I am very proud of along with the whole team - we were honoured to be asked to provide services for one of the worlds largest sporting events. Not only is this prestigious, it's also a single weekend contract which will see a turnover more than 2.5 times that seen in a whole year of this chaps company (before we bought it) - the same chap who told me some "wise words" and claimed there was no money in it.

Was he right? ....Well yes, there was no money in it for him, or his ethos. But it goes to show that a company with the right ethos and people can make it happen in a very short space of time...

So some wise words for today - "If you think you won't or you think you will, you're right - so be positive, change &amp; make it happen!"]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Mark-Zuckerberg.jpg"><img class=" wp-image-506 alignright" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/06/Mark-Zuckerberg.jpg" alt="Mark Zuckerberg" width="314" height="188" /></a>It's a comment often made to 'young entrepreneurs' and one which I am sometimes confused by (maybe I am too young to understand!?)... <strong>But.... "What has age got to do with it?"</strong>

It's unusual for people to make age-related comments to my face, but it's a comment often filtered back to me from those who work for, or simply support the businesses. The normal suspects are competitors (that's to be expected) and skeptics of some degree, but what has age actually got to do with it?

Most people know of Mark Zuckerberg, who together with his college roommates and fellow Harvard University students, launched Facebook from his dormitory room.The group then introduced Facebook onto other campuses nationwide. In 2007, at the <strong>age of 23</strong>, Zuckerberg became a billionaire as a result of Facebook's success. Mark is now a 30 year old Billionaire and is still heavily involved in Facebook to this day...

I am not afraid of telling people that I have a huge amount of support in place from family and friends, not to mention to team who I work with (which was also the case for the Mark Zuckerberg's of this world). Age has absolutely no correlation with how well someone is able to do a job, or indeed run a business. Do you think I do everything myself? of course not... The key is to employ people who are better than you at a particular function and encourage them to succeed - you cannot be good at everything and strategically leading a business is a skill in itself.

Interestingly, one person who commented "I was too young to run a business which deals with peoples lives" is an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ex-policeman</span>! not a Doctor, not a Paramedic... So is a company like ours, ran by a registered Paramedic (that would be me) and clinically led by a highly experienced air ambulance Doctor not more appropriate than one ran by an <span style="text-decoration: underline;">ex-policeman</span>? - This is down to experience, not Age! There are plenty of 22 year old Paramedics on emergency ambulances up and down the country, clinically responsible for patients... so why can't they run a business?

What I would say is this... If you are young and run a business, employ people who can compliment your enthusiasm and experience, with theirs. Earn respect from them and be part of the team.]]></content:encoded>

<div id="stcpDiv">The panel of experts from Lloyds Bank have shortlisted up to ten entries from <a href="http://www.lloydsbankenterpriseawards.com/how-the-awards-work/#regions-table">each of the five heats</a>. <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com">Jigsaw Medical</a> is proud to be one of those shortlisted businesses!</div>
<div></div>
<div>
<div id="stcpDiv">Shortlisted businesses will give a pitch about their company to a <a href="http://www.lloydsbankenterpriseawards.com/judges/">panel of judges</a>, followed by a question and answer session. A Best Start-up, Best Enterprise and Best Digital winner will be selected at each heat to go through to the final. We have been selected into the category of 'Best Enterprise' and on the 16th September I will present our business to the panel of judges.</div>
<div></div>
<div>We are very fortunate as a business to have very stable finances, but the £50,000 investment (should we win overall) would be well invested into cutting edge compliance and CRM software for our recruitment and clinical divisions.</div>

		<title>Growth and Recruitment: A new chaper of Jigsaw Medical</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>Those of you who have been following our progress in <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com">Jigsaw Medical</a> for a while will know that our Clinical &amp; Training divisions are growing sustainably, but fast!</h2>
[caption id="attachment_526" align="alignright" width="300"]<a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/RB.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-526 " style="border: 1px solid black;" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/RB-300x168.jpg" alt="Richard Branson, Kathryn Telford (Jigsaw Paramedic) and Sam Branson" width="300" height="168" /></a> Richard Branson, Kathryn Telford (Jigsaw Paramedic) and Sam Branson[/caption]

If you told me 12 months ago that we would be sponsoring the Virgin STRIVE Challenge, providing a medical team from the o2 Arena to the top of the Mattahorn in Swizerland... and end up with a photograph with Richard Branson, Sam Branson and one of our great Paramedics... I wouldn't be convinced. <strong>This is the amazing thing about being at the helm of Jigsaw Medical!</strong>

Its been a very busy and sometimes challenging journey so far, but one which I would not change for anything. Since the business was born back in February 2012 we have acquired one of our competitors (and the very first company I worked for), increased the headcount significantly and diversified into a comprehensive service, training and recruitment provider - it is the launch of the latter which will see our new chapter in this amazing journey.

Whilst our Training &amp; Clinical divisions have grown to nearly 5 times the size they were last year, we took an un-missable opportunity to diversify once again into leg 3, of our three leg strategy. The provision of <a href="http://recruitment.jigsawmedical.com/">Locum Doctors</a>, Nurses &amp; Paramedics was already what we did, to a degree, however we did not have a formal, staffing-only service provision available to private hospitals, ambulance trusts or NHS Hospitals... enter, the Jigsaw Medical <a href="http://recruitment.jigsawmedical.com">Recruitment Division</a>.

Each of our three divisions can operate completely independently, but importantly - they can also complement each other entirely. We can recruit, train and deploy staff in one provision, in one business - this is extremely unique.

In a market worth over £23 billion, it is exciting to expand into recruitment whilst maintaining our patient centred approach. We have recruited an amazing bunch of people to run our recruitment division and I really look forward to growing all three divisions together and welcoming people to #TeamJigsaw in the months &amp; years to come.]]></content:encoded>

"It's all about the brand", or "Get the brand out there"...</h2>
I'm sure people think I am mad, but there is method in my madness! (at least I think there is).

At the heart of a great business is a first class product or service and every business wants to be a customer’s ‘first choice’. Building and managing a brand can play a large part in making this happen and if you want to strengthen and manage the perceptions of your business, then a strong brand is needed. Good branding elevates and differentiates your like-for-like products or services and gives your customers reason to choose you over your competitors.

<strong>But I'm a small business, why should I bother?</strong>
<div>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>The most important reason is that it can help increase your sales. This means that when you need to increase your prices (because you are a small company, and there are only so many hours in the day) then your target audience will be accepting of your price increase. Think about it like this - if your company is built upon a solid brand base, you can build up to the next stage successfully without losing the trust of your customers.</li>
	<li>Branding also encourages confidence and trust in your product/service - If you do experience a one-off issue with a product or service, your customers would be more likely to understand, if your brand ethos proves that you’ll do what it takes to resolve the problem.</li>
	<li>Branding also develops the uniqueness of your product.</li>
</ul>
<strong>Trademarks?</strong>

Once your brand has been born and your clients, staff and stakeholders begin to trust your business, you need to protect it. This is a vital part of a business which many people miss out (including the big companies!). Unless you protect your intellectual property then people can just take it from you and damage that hard work you have put into your brand becoming a trusted and powerful force... <a href="http://www.ipo.gov.uk/types/tm.htm">Find out more about trademarks here</a>

<strong><a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/10620589_529819897118201_8065042768012037413_n.jpg"><img class="wp-image-531 alignleft" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/10620589_529819897118201_8065042768012037413_n.jpg" alt="10620589_529819897118201_8065042768012037413_n" width="296" height="222" /></a></strong><strong>Getting the brand out there</strong>

It still amazes me how many companies operate vans with absolutely no branding on at all - that's a big area of virtually free advertising not being utilised. At <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com">Jigsaw Medical</a> we take our brand under our wing; our ambulances, response cars, support vehicles and training vans are all heavily branded. It doesn't stop there, with a powerful social presence and more merchandise than you can shake a stick at. Mugs, coasters, pens and mouse-mats - you name it, we have our logo on it!

Many businesses do not believe in promotional items, however I really do think that if its something people will use and it has your brand and contact details on it - surely it can't be a bad idea. You would be amazed how many hospital staff rooms are filled with our bright yellow mugs and matching mouse-mat and coasters!
<h2><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>But Remember!</strong></span></h2>
<p id="stcpDiv"><span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>Branding goes way beyond just a logo or a few mugs... When you think about your brand, you really want to think about your entire customer experience…everything from your logo, your website, your social media experiences, the way you answer the phone, to the way your customers experience your staff. Once you have a brand, you need to live up to its expectations and protect it from harm.</strong></span></p>

It's not all about beanbag rooms, granted - but having a business where people enjoy to come to work, enjoy the environment and contribute to the way in which they work and the environment they do it in. A new member of our team recently said to me that they loved coming to work and worryingly, they also said they have rarely experienced that in the past. I personally love coming to work and I am thrilled that the team do too, I think that's what makes us stand out from the crowd.
<h3>The single most important thing in ANY business, is its people!</h3>
It may seem easy to employ people and get them into your team, but you also need to make sure you retain the talent you have managed to acquire and develop. I'm really proud of the expanding team we are building at <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com">Jigsaw</a>, but I am also aware that we need to make sure we stay '<strong>a great place to work</strong>'. Now (and as we are growing), we need to keep the team involved in everything we do, whether that be what quotes we have on a new wall, what chairs we have in our board rooms - Jigsaw House is, and needs to continue to be a spectacular and special place to work - one which is unique and difficult to replicate by our competitors.
<h3>Are we 'a great place to work'?</h3>
... I certainly hope so, but one thing I do know is that we come together as a team and plan what to do next to make Jigsaw House and even more amazing place to be.]]></content:encoded>

"it's about being different"![/caption]

<strong>It’s not about ‘emulation’ or ‘following suit’…</strong> Copying an existing business will not work – unless you take the bits they are not doing well and make those same 'bits' better in your business. There is a strong case for not re-inventing the wheel and I totally agree with this, but why mirror an imperfect business model when you can innovate and improve it, making it even better!?

There are thousands of businesses doing the same thing we do in the three divisions we cover in Jigsaw Medical, all over the UK…

<strong>So why are we succeeding?</strong>

We have simply taken what the industry doesn’t do very well, and made it 10 times better. For example in the £23 billion market that is recruitment, there are many small and large players – but as an innovative and positive business - ran by clinicians, we know what the rest do well and what they don’t do well. We listen to our locums and make Jigsaw Medical the place they want to commit to, bend over backwards for and have a lot of fun being a part of.

It's about having the right people, doing the right jobs and empowering them enough so they stand out to other employers, but treating them so they won't want to! Business leaders often forget about the people who help them to succeed, it's the leading cause of attrition in high-performing teams and specifically key team members... Be careful, if you operate like this, not only would nobody want to copy your business, there is often a competitor with the right qualities waiting in the sidelines!

Don’t just copy someone else’s business, take the industry by the reins, and <strong>make it better! </strong>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/solicitors.jpg"><img class="size-medium wp-image-552 alignright" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/solicitors-300x197.jpg" alt="solicitors" width="300" height="197" /></a>In business you are likely to require legal advice from time-to-time... it's a fact of life in a commercial world...</h2>
Getting the right advice, from the right solicitors is key when moving forward and protecting your business. Over the last couple of years, during the (thankfully rare) legal matters we have had to either defend or address - we have obtained a great pool of legal firms in order to protect our brand and commercial interests, we have built solid relationships with them and ensure they are ready to act, should this be required.... it also helps that my girlfriend is in the legal world - but she would probably disagree, and for that reason, we don't engage with her professional services directly (but its a perfect place for quick and comparitive advice)!

I remember the very first 'legal letter' I got at aged just 14. It was regarding my 'next big thing' which, during my naive, younger years - got me into a bit of bother (although it did fizzle out when they realised, at the time, all I had was a laptop and a skateboard). The law firm in question specialises in Intellectual Property Law, the letter was fantastically written and so much so, you can guess who we now use for our IP legal requirements now?!

It's amazing really, the bigger your brand &amp; company gets and the more of a commercial threat it poses to your competitors - the more legal correspondence which is required, not just that - the more you need protect your brand (though trademarks etc - see <a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/brand/" target="_blank">here</a>) the more legal input will be required. Although this is not a scientific calculation, I am sure you can imagine their rationale. I guess the truth is, they should be reading my article on: "<a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/concentrate-on-you/">Concentrating on your business, not your competitors</a>"

But seriously, having the right legal advisers not only protects your business, but also ensures your approach to legal matters is professional and above all - accurate. We have previously received some terribly written, infactual and very unprofessional 'high street' Solicitors letters - so you can imagine how that reflects on those concerned on the 'other side of the fence'.

<strong>Some top tips when selecting your business' Solicitors....</strong>
<div>
<ul>
	<li>Make sure you are clear and focused about what you are trying to achieve so you don’t waste your time and money.</li>
	<li>Before you make any appointments, talk to three or four different firms – you’ll want information about charges, how they handle the longer term adviser/client relationship if that’s relevant - and anything else that is important to you, such as whether they are willing to come and see you in your own workplace.</li>
	<li>Look at their qualifications – what they are, what they mean; ask how long the firm has been in business, <strong>and what your adviser specialises in</strong>! (having a high-street 'generalist' lawyer dealing, for example, with your employment law matters is simply not good!)</li>
	<li>Do they talk to you in plain English or are they using jargon terms that you don’t understand?</li>
	<li>Solicitors should have a practising certificate, which tells you they are fully qualified and insured, which most display in their offices.  If you have any concerns, you can check with the <a href="http://www.sra.org.uk/home/home.page">Solicitors Regulatory Authority</a>.</li>
	<li><strong>and Finally...</strong><strong> Don't be afraid of spending money on senior Partners and highly-commended Solicitors, at the end of the day - it is your business you are protecting.</strong></li>
</ul>

<h2>Suppliers can seriously affect the quality of your products/services and your ability to deliver on your promises!</h2>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/creditscore.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-560" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/creditscore.png" alt="creditscore" width="1055" height="350" /></a><em>This check was done just now, comparing our credit check (on the right), with one of our competitors (left) – obviously we won't tell you which stone you would find them under! - <strong>but the difference is clear!</strong>
</em></p>
If a supplier lets you down, you let your customers down (or in our business, your patients could be at risk). This can damage your business' or NHS Trusts reputation and cause clinical or operational problems. Choosing a supplier without seeing their business report could cost you, or worse, your patients.

Getting a business report to check suppliers helps establish their stability and their ability to provide a quality service, in both the medium and long term. Choosing a reliable, financially stable supplier means that you can be confident you can always fulfil commitments to your customers.
<h4>A supplier check can help you choose the right people to work with</h4>
Business Check from Experian allows you to take an inside look at your current or potential suppliers – that’s what we use!
<strong>A business report lets you check suppliers by seeing information on:</strong>
<ul>
	<li>The stability of suppliers by seeing their credit score</li>
	<li>The future reliability of suppliers with alerts on any changes in their status</li>
</ul>
<h3><strong>With accurate information from a supplier check profile, you can make the right choices for your patients, Trust or business!</strong></h3>

		<title>The Journey So Far - A Moment Of Reflection &amp; Teamwork!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-17-at-17.06.54.png"><img class="alignright  wp-image-569" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/Screen-Shot-2014-10-17-at-17.06.54-300x214.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-10-17 at 17.06.54" width="300" height="214" /></a>Following our success in winning the Northern heats of the Lloyds Bank Enterprise Awards we were invited to the Grand Final...</h2>
Although Jigsaw Medical didn't bag the 'grand final prize', settling with the 'Best Enterprise - North' award is something I am immensely proud of the team for and whilst sat with some very inspirational people (which I will come to later), I had time to reflect on where we have been and where we have come...

It seems like only a matter of weeks ago that I was sat with my parents deciding on what to call, what would become '<a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com">Jigsaw Medical</a>' and persuading them that the 'pocket money' I would earn from, at the time, doing event first aid cover, would outweigh the costs of a vehicle, the numerous insurances etc. But as business owners themselves, they fully supported me and helped me get in contact with insurance companies and even (with a slight bending of the ear), let me use one of their company vans! - I must have forgotten to tell them at the time, but I planned on converting into an Ambulance response car - much to their delight on its return from the conversion company! (but that's history... I hope).

Whilst I was sat amongst senior executives from Lloyds Bank, CEO's of multi-national companies and inspiring business leaders, I had time to reflect on what Jigsaw Medical has 'grown up to be'. I was sat there with my Parents and Sammie (my girlfriend) and numerous people wanted to hear all about the business, which was fine, because I can talk about it all day!!

<a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/teamjigsaw.png"><img class="wp-image-568 alignleft" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/10/teamjigsaw.png" alt="teamjigsaw" width="357" height="238" /></a>Sat on the 'Jigsaw Medical table' was <a href="http://www.tonyrobinsonobe.co.uk/">Tony Robbinson OBE</a>, not only was he such a gent and such an inspiring chap, it was an absolute pleasure to be in his company, hear his stories and experiences. <a href="http://www.tim-campbell.co.uk/">Tim Campbell MBE</a> was also judging the final and it was amazing to hear his story and experience his frankly awesome speech! - I was humbled to be amongst some inspirational and amazing people, something I had not experienced before - with the 'spotlight' being on us.

But it was this that made me realise something.... the journey I had embarked upon in February 2012 had brought me to that position, sat on that table, surrounded by 'Jigsaw Medical' branding, a 6-foot high picture of my face (which they must have forgotten to tell me about!). Not to mention being in the company of two legends such as Tony, Tim and the amazing judges. But it's not that which really made me reflect on where we are today. Although I had the pleasure of being there and pitching the company to these influential and powerful people, <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>It is not me</strong></span> who has simply landed there by mistake (or at least I hope not) and certainly not single-handedly, its the teamwork and the amazing people we have on-board the Jigsaw journey that has got us there, it just happens to be me who founded the business and has the pleasure to lead the team. I knew that already, but when you reflect on how far the team has come, it's pretty amazing!! We call these people #TeamJigsaw and it includes everyone, our Locum Doctors and Nurses, event Paramedics, sales team, office team, recruitment team, first aiders and the team in FM - absolutely <strong>everyone</strong> involved in the business as a whole. It is these people who determine its success, not me.

With all of the growth and concentration in the entire team, I wouldn't say "I didn't know how far we have come", but I certainly didn't appreciate our collective success, as an entire team and when I compare it to where we were just 12 months ago, with 300% growth a successful acquisition and a rapidly growing team!
<h3>Tim, Tony and the whole experience of the Enterprise Awards made me reflect and really put our achievements so far into perspective, so I suppose all that would be left to say is....</h3>
<h2><span style="text-decoration: underline;"><em>Thank You</em> to the awesome #TeamJigsaw!</span> - Here's to the next part of the journey....</h2>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Business Dress Code... Suit or Jeans?...</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>I recently had an interesting debate with some of my family about what I should wear to meetings...</h2>
<strong>My general rule has always been Suits &amp; Ties are for Weddings, Funerals and Court... those in <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com">Jigsaw Medical</a> and my family know this well and when I occasionally do put a suit on, they get very concerned indeed!</strong>

<a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/0210-MARK-ZUCKERBERG-sized.jpg_full_600.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-583" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/0210-MARK-ZUCKERBERG-sized.jpg_full_600-161x300.jpg" alt="0210-MARK-ZUCKERBERG-sized.jpg_full_600" width="161" height="300" /></a>I personally think there are no rules about suits, ties and any of the other 60's contraptions that people think constitute 'business wear'. I honestly think that gone are the days of Directors and business people wearing suits. My rule has always been that people dress smartly but more importantly, comfortably... maybe one day we will do some experiment to prove my theory that comfortable people work more efficiently, happily and enjoy going to work more - but to me, its common sense.

Don't get me wrong, I believe in people being smart, but I would never insist on someone wearing a suit... and certainly not a tie! (I do share <a href="http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/why-it%E2%80%99s-time-to-say-bye-to-the-tie">Mr Branson's view on ties</a>!). Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg, the late Steve Jobs and Richard Branson (to name a few) do not wear traditional suits... I really <span style="text-decoration: underline;">don't</span> believe there is science in this next statement, but look how creative, forward thinking and successful these three people are and have been! I recently met Richard Reed (the Founder of Innocent Drinks), again he was in a t-shirt a jeans - another hugely creative and successful guy... maybe that's because they worked in comfort?

If I existed in business 25 years ago (or was even born), I am sure my view may be different - but then again as was the world, technology and the existence of small businesses to the extent they are today. To some extent I think people wear what they have been brought up to wear.

I don't wear a suit (if I can help it), that's not me being arrogant, its me being comfortable so I can perform my best. Those who disagree with my dress code often say they don't feel at work without a suit on, in which case they may well feel more comfortable in a suit! (but I would urge them to try the jeans, shirt and suit jacket attire!)
<h4>Some will agree, some will disagree, but as long as people are smart, comfortable and happy - that sounds good to me!</h4>]]></content:encoded>

		<title>An office in Sydney... now I didn&#039;t expect to be saying that just 2 years into the journey!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>I must say, I didn't think I would be writing about an office in Australia for some years yet, but it is testament to the team at <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com">Jigsaw Medical</a> that we have managed to make this bold move so soon in our journey..<a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sydney_harbour.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-593" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/sydney_harbour-300x199.jpg" alt="sydney_harbour" width="300" height="199" /></a></h3>
Granted, we are not the first recruitment agency, training company or clinical provider who has made such a move. However, we will be the only UK based agency dealing with Paramedics internationally, on this scale. Our aim is to use this new brand (Jigsaw Medical Global) and our presence in Australia to drive recruitment in and out of the UK, with offshore and onshore opportunities already available globally. It has been an amazing journey, especially given that I only actual finished university and became a full-time member of the team, just 16 months ago! The markets in all three divisions of our business are saturated, but I have learn't over this short space of time, that it really doesn't matter - <span style="text-decoration: underline;">providing what you are doing is different</span> (those of you who have been to Jigsaw House will have seen quotes to this effect all over the walls!).

The whole team at Jigsaw Medical are so pleased to have made this positive and forward thinking move, we are uniquely placed to recruit, train and deploy heath-care staff across our three divisions; something that to our knowledge, has never been done before. It is an absolute credit to our team that we have got to this point so quickly and we are really looking forward to developing our Global team at our Sydney office and beyond…

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>The first time I had the chance to really stop and think about where we have come in 2014 was when designing the front cover of our annual review...</h2>
<a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-22-at-16.18.16.png"><img class="alignright wp-image-601 size-medium" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Screen-Shot-2014-12-22-at-16.18.16-218x300.png" alt="Screen Shot 2014-12-22 at 16.18.16" width="218" height="300" /></a>I found myself looking through the Jigsaw Medical Facebook pictures to design an eye catching cover for our 2014 Annual Report, the first of its kind since the beginnings of Jigsaw Medical. With pictures of our team with <a href="http://www.virgin.com/richard-branson">Richard Branson</a> and Sam Branson at the <a href="https://www.strivechallenge.com/">Virgin STRIVE Challenge</a>, images from the 'Tour de France' and of our ambulances queuing up outside A&amp;E departments on 999 work with various trusts.

It was at this point that I was able to stop and reflect, I wouldn't say I forgot about everything we have done this year, but rather that we were too busy on the very fast road of growth to do so. (something I'm sure I will set as a goal for 2015, so I do more of it!). Nonetheless this urged me to send an email to the team across our three offices to thank them for their efforts in 2014 and highlight some of the amazing things that we, together, have achieved. I would like to think I give thanks to the team very regularly, but the realisation of what we have achieved holistically is something easily forgotten in this fast-pace environment we have created.

I remember just 12 months ago, sitting with my family at the Blackhouse Grill in Chester, discussing my (at the time) rather ambitious vision for Jigsaw Medical. I distinctly remember saying <em>"I would love to be sat here in a few years seeing a Jigsaw Medical ambulance driving past the window, on a 999 call"</em>. Strangely, last Friday I was sat in this same restaurant with some of the team from Jigsaw Medical, celebrating our achievements in 2014. Just 12 months on, that goal became a reality as 'JA603', one of our Emergency Ambulances drove past whilst on contract with the local NHS Ambulance Service... for me that was a huge moment and something which will stick with me forever, there was a moment of madness in the restaurant as the team saw one of our own driving past! It may seem a bit cheesy, but there is absolutely nothing like the feeling of hitting these goals, especially when you least expect it!
<h4>So... Jigsaw Medical in 2014 - A Review...</h4>
<a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2014-@-Jigsaw.jpg"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-1151" src="http://www.jigsawmedical.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/2014-@-Jigsaw.jpg" alt="Processed with Moldiv" width="259" height="260" /></a><strong>A <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com/blog/jigsaw-medical-2014-review/">recent blog entry from Neil Coleman</a>, our social media &amp; PR guru summarised things nicely! I have taken some key bits from his post...</strong>

What a year it’s been at Jigsaw Medical. Unrivalled growth, exciting event coverage, overseas expansion, laughs, tears and everything that comes along with being part of one of the UK’s leading and most innovative medical recruitment, clinical and training companies. 2014 saw the establishment of a new <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com/recruitment/">recruitment division</a> that offers a formal, staffing-only service provision available to private hospitals, ambulance trusts and NHS hospitals.

It has also been a particularly exciting year for our <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com/home.html">clinical division</a>, as Jigsaw provided medical cover not only for traditional ambulance settings but also for:
<ul>
	<li>Virgin STRIVE challenge – providing a medical team for 10 people who ran, rowed, cycled, hiked and climbed from the O2 arena in London to the peak of the Matterhorn in Switzerland.</li>
	<li>Tour de France Grand Départ – supporting the first aid providers, NHS ambulance services and event medical management company with the provision of 227 paramedics, nurses and doctors throughout the 2 days.</li>
	<li>The Big Reunion, UK’s Biggest Winter Music Festival – providing comprehensive medical services and treatment for all festival goers.</li>
	<li>Various NHS 999 Contracts - supporting NHS trusts with emergency 999 calls, accross the UK.</li>
</ul>
<a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jigsaw-Medical-Global-Glow-Bg.png"><img class="aligncenter wp-image-968" src="http://www.jigsawmedical.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/Jigsaw-Medical-Global-Glow-Bg.png" alt="Jigsaw-Medical-Global-Glow-Bg" width="277" height="72" /></a>2014 also saw the creation of <a href="http://www.jigsawmedicalglobal.com/">Jigsaw Medical Global</a>. This expansion has seen the Jigsaw Medical brand go to Sydney, Australia to become the only UK based agency to deal with paramedics internationally on this scale. The aim is to use this opportunity to drive recruitment in and out of the UK, with offshore and onshore opportunities already available to UK based candidates and global candidates.

<strong>All of the above has contributed to a 350% growth in comparison to where we were in 2013 so we’d like to say a massive thank you and congratulations to everyone at #TeamJigsaw for a fantastic 2014.</strong>
<h3>2014 In Summary</h3>
I think it is safe to say that we as a team are as shocked as everyone else to see where we have come, although it has taken a considerable amount of effort from the entire team to get it right. We needed to ensure we kept delivering the same, clinically focused service to our clients and patients is something we made a priority at every step. To be honest, I personally feel that having the right people on-board, improving our service delivery and clinical focus has resulted in much of this staggering growth.

Our growth has also seen a 300% increase in the size of our full-time office &amp; training team, with over 2,000 candidates joining #TeamJigsaw over the last few months. We took some bold steps for a young company in 2014, but we have done it with the right support and the right people on board, from our appointment of our Finance Director, to ensure the growth is financially sustainable and our Medical Director, to ensure it is clinically appropriate. Not to mention those with a wealth of experience to drive us forward strategically, including <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com/blog/jms-appoints-laurie-percival-as-non-executive-director/">Laurie Percival</a> who came to us from her position as CEO of a £500 million recruitment brand.

I am convinced the single reason for our growth and success in 2014 is <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com/our-people.html">our people</a>, who we like to call #TeamJigsaw! - <strong>So thank you to everyone who has helped make this year so successful!</strong>
<h3>What to Expect in 2015?</h3>
Needless to say, we have a plan. However, our plan for this year has been exceeded more than three times over - so who knows what to expect. However, what I will say is that it will see more amazing people join #TeamJigsaw and we hope to increase revenue and profits by some 500%, largely down to our sustained growth &amp; innovation across the three divisions within the business. We will have more shifts for locum workers, more courses in our training division, lots more clinical service provision to events, private &amp; NHS clients, and international opportunities for UK Paramedics - to name a few.

In a nutshell we want to continue on from 2014 with a vision to 'revamping' the UK medical recruitment market, continuing to innovate and develop in our Clinical &amp; Training divisions. I truly believe we have a unique model with the very best team, something which I can see being very powerful and pioneering in 2015, and beyond.
<h3>I will leave you with this thought...</h3>
I love quotes and those of you who have visited us at Jigsaw House will know that (they are all over the walls). The most recent of which is a selection for my new office, for example one from Walt Disney - "If you can dream it, you can do it"....

<strong>...However more prudent to this blog post, another reads....</strong>

<h3>One of the quotes in my office is from Walt Disney and it reads: "If you can dream it, you can do it"... but how do dreamers become doers?...</h3>
Granted, it is true that the 'doing' part of this statement is the harder part of the two, but I strongly believe that the above quote is very true. Most of the time, it is the fear of failure or 'not knowing where to start' which stops entrepreneurs from 'doing' rather than 'dreaming'!
<h3>Some top tips which might just help you to turn your dreams into reality!</h3>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Have goals! - </strong>You should have goals, whether they are just a goal for Monday, a goal for the month or a goal further ahead… You need them to be the first thing you do on your quest to develop your dream into reality! Don’t forget – if your goal involves your team (which I’m sure it will), you need to share it with them, so they can also focus on helping you reach it!</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Surround yourself with doers, not dreamers -</strong>  I think it is safe to say everyone has dreams, but make sure you are surrounding yourself with positive, like-minded people - particularly if they themselves have turned some of their dreams into reality, they will no doubt have some pointers for you from their journey.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Nothing is impossible! - </strong>If you think your goal is out of reach, think again. Whilst I wouldn't encourage anyone to try and beat Richard Branson into space tourism with a start-up business, you should work towards milestones to ultimately get you to the main goal. Be realistic, but don't make it easily achievable - that's boring!<strong>
</strong></li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Be better -</strong> Take some time to sit down &amp; figure out how your biggest competitor is promoting their brand &amp; plan something smarter &amp; more creative for yours... Don't re-invent the wheel without being creative!</li>
</ul>
<h3>Will it work!?</h3>
... If everyone knew the answer to that question, we would all be very successful in everything we wanted to do... But I do believe, nothing is impossible if you have the right people and the right formula.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Turning to Twitter for Customer Service...</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3><a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Customer-Service-on-Twitter-sorry.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-618" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/Customer-Service-on-Twitter-sorry.png" alt="Customer-Service-on-Twitter-sorry" width="540" height="301" /></a></h3>
<h3>Many businesses are turning to Twitter and other social media platforms for their customer service, are you Tweeting back?</h3>
I'm sure that I'm not the only person who turns to Twitter, Facebook or finding the CEO on Linkedin when I have a query or problem? People often want instant responses to their customer service queries, not emails which often take 24hrs to respond to! I think it's safe to say that social media has a massive impact on how a company is perceived to the public, especially the response time from Tweets, whether that's a rare complaint, question or sales enquiry. So much so, many businesses (including Jigsaw Medical) employ dedicated people in their teams to manage their social media requirements (our is <a href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com/blog/jigsaw-medical-appoints-social-media-pr-intern/">Neil Coleman</a>, who looks more like Olly Murs!).

I recently had a positive experience of social media based customer support with <a href="http://www.londonmidland.com/">London Midland Trains </a>and whilst they couldn't rectify the issue, the response from them via Twitter was both speedy and appropriate. Other great examples comes from some of our suppliers, such as <a href="http://www.ukfast.co.uk">UKFast</a> and our clients, including the many <a href="http://www.virgin.com">Virgin</a> brands you see around the world - they all seem to have exceptional Twitter interaction &amp; support!
<h3><a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/social-channles-image-01.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-621" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/social-channles-image-01-300x184.jpg" alt="social-channles-image-01" width="300" height="184" /></a>Why should your business use Social Media?...</h3>
There still seems to be a clear split between businesses and indeed the people within them as to their view on how businesses should use social media. Many see employing people to manage social media as a strange move - but I can assure you it's not! Here are some top reasons why you should be using social media:

<strong>Customer Service -</strong> This is the  main reason why you should use social media for your business. You will be able to connect with your customers because they themselves are using it. Specifically Twitter has become a daily routine for many consumers and businesses alike, if you have an unsatisfied customer you are likely to hear from them on twitter (whether or not your company has a presence!). Surely it's better to manage their feedback publicly on Twitter, rather than not know about it at all!?

<strong>Branding -</strong> You don’t have to be a big brand like Google or Starbucks to brand yourself on social media channels. For many, the use of Twitter, Linkedin and Facebook is an opportunity to re-enforce the brand and what better for a huge advertising platform than this! Many businesses (including Jigsaw Medical, which is why you are reading this) also have their Directors or leaders on Twitter and other social platforms.

<strong>News - </strong>Social media is also a great platform to share your news with your followers and keep them updated with the latest 'happenings' in your organisation.

<strong>"It's gone viral!"</strong> - If you have succeeded gaining some popularity with your social media accounts you will know how viral they can be. This will be part of your marketing strategies that you can use in the future. Hey, it worked for Justin Beiber! - just think of social media as a free advertising platform.

<strong>Willingness to act</strong> - I personally think this is the single most important reason your business should use Social Media. If you allow yourself to be potentially exposed on social media, with the correct management this can be seen extremely positively by your clients. This shows willingness and transparency, reassuring your customers that you are willing to act on peoples concerns or feedback.

<strong>Everyone's doing it!</strong> - The guy who runs the local sweet shop down the road. The landscape architect. The shoe shop owner. And lots of big companies, such as Dell, HP, 02 and Microsoft. Having your business on Twitter is seen as a must.
<h3>The golden rules...<a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/golden-rules.png"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-622" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/golden-rules.png" alt="golden-rules" width="700" height="200" /></a></h3>
<strong>1. If your going to do it, do it properly! </strong>- Don't fall into the trap of thinking social media is a great idea for your business, setting up your Facebook page, Twitter account and Linkedin company page - then leaving it for 12-months post-less! Unmanaged social media accounts are bad news and when your latest customer searches your company name on social media channels and sees the inactivity - it looks worse than not being on social media at all! No matter how small your business, as a minimum you should aim to do at least one tweet, Facebook and LinkedIn post, each week. If you don't have time to do this, there are lots of web and marketing company's who can manage this on you behalf for little cost, but remember, it's always better coming from you.

<strong>2. Whilst your at it, get the boss on too</strong> - Whether your organisation is large or small, professional accounts for the leaders, founders and Directors can also work in your company's favor. I am on Twitter, Facebook and Linkedin and I often get queries direct to my account, rather than the companies. This again shows <span class="st">transparency</span> and allows people to really become involved and get a complete view of the organisation holistically. Whilst this isn't for everyone, I really enjoy the feedback from our clients and team on social media and it's something which allows me to be easily accessible if someone does have an issue.

<strong>3. Think before you Tweet </strong>- Having been here myself on a number of occasions it can often be too easy to respond in a confrontational way if someone (such as a competitor) is being less than polite about your business on social media. This is one of the reasons why Neil manages Jigsaw Medical's social media, he is a professional and ensures our responses as a company are both appropriate, yet professional. My advice is to take 10 minutes before replying and I can assure you the words you chose in your response will be very different. Just remember, once its on social media, its on for life - whether you delete it or not, the damage is often done.

<strong>4. Set goals</strong> - Yes, I'm always squeezing this one in... but goals can apply to anything. For example, your goal could be to gain 500 followers on Twitter in the first six months, so set this and monitor it. The great thing about social media is that you can share these goals with your audience. One great example of this was when I recently provided an opportunity for one of my followers on Twitter to win a famous Jigsaw Medical bobble hat! This worked really well and I hit the target of reaching 40,000 followers that day. Be creative and engage your followers as much as you can.

<strong>5. It's not just about numbers - </strong>Don't get yourself bogged down with how many followers you do or don't have, concentrate on those you do have, engage with them and make them feel part of your journey. Don’t try to follow 10,000 people straight away. You’ll just come across as a spammer. There is no value in a multitude of followers or 'likes' if they don’t really care about what you have to say. It’s about conversations, relationships and engagement, not the masses. Build your “network” gradually and consistently. Be selective, be targeted, and be clear on what your objectives are.
<h3>Whats next?</h3>
If you haven't already, get your social media accounts setup and start engaging with your customers!]]></content:encoded>

Firstly, you should remember that a business may at first be the vision of just one person, but soon becomes the vision of the whole team of people you employ or involve in your business. <strong>So rule number one; let your team come up with the goals as well as you! </strong>If your business culture is similar to Jigsaw's the business is as much your teams as it is yours.

I am a keen believer in goals and lining up a target, this goes for business and personal life. My business goals come in all shapes and sizes and focus on different aspects of my businesses. At the beginning of the year it is important to lay some foundation goals - where do you want to get to that year?, where do your team what to get to? and importantly make them measurable, objective and realistic (although #TeamJigsaw would tell you mine are often very ambitious!).
<h2>Involve your team</h2>
I know I am repeating myself here. But don’t forget, your goals with invariably involve your team, so you need to share it with them and involve them in the goal setting process, so they can also focus on helping you reach it! Don’t just keep it to yourself!
<h2><a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/10868092_989236447771079_4293696508673558744_n.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-631 size-medium" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/01/10868092_989236447771079_4293696508673558744_n-300x300.jpg" alt="10868092_989236447771079_4293696508673558744_n" width="300" height="300" /></a>Sit back before you set...</h2>
I recently went away skiing at the beginning of January and something I have picked up from <a href="http://www.lawrencejones.eu">Lawrence Jones MBE</a> is that taking time out to look at the bigger picture is vital (something it took me a while to get the hang of). You would be amazed what spending time on the mountains with your family can spark in your goal setting and even thought process - try it!

Today I have the first board meeting of the year and in the 'upside down management' structure we have in Jigsaw Medical - the goals have already been set, the team have come together and made a plan for 2015, so lets hope its an awesome one.
<h2>Some personal goals...</h2>
As well as the goals for the business (which you should share), I think its also important to have some personal goals to keep yourself motivated. They can be kept to yourself or shared with your friends, family or colleagues... Here are a couple of mine:
<ul>
	<li>To visit <a href="http://www.virginlimitededition.com/en/necker-island">Necker Island</a> at some point in 2015</li>
	<li>To make in profit, what we generated in revenue in 2014 (this is a personal one as its one of those 'ambitious ones' I spoke of. However, we did do this in 2014, so nothing is impossible!)</li>
	<li>To further support start-up businesses, just like I was in February 2012</li>
</ul>
<h2>... so what are your goals for 2015?</h2>]]></content:encoded>

This morning reminded me of what such a dedicated team can achieve. I woke up to a text message from our Operations Manager (Jon Gooding), which outlined where he had spent the night... (this might sound somewhat ominous, but I can assure you it's not!) He actually spent until 02:45 this morning at our head office, solving a time-critical mechanical issue with one of our vehicles which resulted in it being taken to a 24hr Mercedes garage to be fixed, keeping our operations unaffected.
<h3><a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Y2TN11.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-639" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Y2TN11-199x300.jpg" alt="Y2TN11" width="199" height="300" /></a>A 9 to 5 Job...</h3>
Jon, like many of our head office and training team, works 9-5 with an additional on-call rota. He didn't have to come in last night and rectify this issue - but he did, which meant we had a happy client.

The same can also be said for our recruitment team, who take calls at midnight from staff in hospitals and on shifts UK Wide. It can also be said for our training team who offer to deliver courses in the evenings or the weekends to fit in with our clients requirements. Our finance team, who stay until 8pm to make sure our payroll is ran and #TeamJigsaw get paid on-time; or our sales team, who books an event on a Friday night, for the following day to ensure their event is able to continue. Not least our 24/7 ambulance crews who work over their allotted shift time to ensure a critically ill baby can be quickly transferred to receive the care they desperately need, or our Doctors, Nurses &amp; Paramedics who go that extra mile to get the job done right.

All of this results in us giving our clients what they want and our patients what they need, providing that second-to-none service we aim to achieve. Many of our clients won't see what happens behind the scenes at #TeamJigsaw, but I can assure you this group of amazing people never cease to amaze me.

We don't aim to 'overwork' our team, but when working for a fast-growing business such as Jigsaw Medical, having people who go that extra mile really makes us stand out from the crowd!
<h3>It's about the people</h3>
When people ask me the secret to the success of Jigsaw Medical so far, I respond unequivocally with "it's the team, not me". This is often responded to with a laugh - perhaps they expected me to say something else?

I think it's safe to say, the above proves that its the people who make the difference.
<h3>Thank you #TeamJigsaw - here's to a successful 2015</h3>]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>After unprecedented growth of 382% and an increase in profits of 213% in 2014, #TeamJigsaw is happy to announce the appointment of a new PR &amp; Social Media Manager and a new Recruitment Consultant for our Nurses department.</h3>
Neil Coleman and Matt Jones are appointed to the respective posts of PR and Social Media Manager, and Recruitment Consultant. Neil was looking for a career change and joins us after completing a 3 month internship, having previously had more than seven years in customer service and account management. Matt joins #TeamJigsaw's nurse recruitment division after 14 years’ in sales and customer service.

As well as these new additions we are looking to add to the team, and are currently recruiting candidates for two new roles; a <a title="Recruitment Compliance Administrator Job Description" href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com/connect/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Compliance-Administrator.pdf" target="_blank">Recruitment Compliance Administrator</a> and an <a title="Accounts/Payroll Administrator Job Description" href="http://www.jigsawmedical.com/connect/wp-content/uploads/2015/02/Accounts-Payroll-Administrator.pdf" target="_blank">Accounts/Payroll Administrator</a>.

The role of Recruitment Compliance Administrator would suit some who ideally has experience within the medical or recruitment industry, is able to work flexibly but office-based, has exceptional organisational skills and has interest in planning their own time effectively. They will be working with healthcare professionals to ensure their documentation is stored correctly onto an in-house database.

Additionally, the Accounts/Payroll Administrator role would suit someone who ideally has experience of operating the payroll and raising invoices within the medical or recruitment industry and is an excellent communicator with good organisational skills.

I'm a firm believe that people are at the heart of our success. We are proud of our creative and positive working environment, and strive to make sure our team enjoy coming to work.

Jigsaw was built on foundations of transparent and collaborative working from board level to each area of our business.

If candidates would like to apply for either of the roles or find out more, they can contact our team on <a class="DetectedNumber" title="01829 732615" href="dial:01829732615">01829 732615</a> or email <a href="mailto:recruitment@jigsawmedical.com">recruitment@jigsawmedical.com</a>.

		<title>CEO Selfie for Comic Relief</title>

<h1 class="quoteText">“No one has ever become poor by giving.” – Anne Frank.</h1>
In order to help celebrate Comic Relief day this year I've decided to take part in the #CEOSelfie campaign.

The aim of the campaign is for CEOs around the country to help change the face of their business by posting a selfie on the CEO Selfie website (www.ceoselfie.co.uk) and making a donation to Comic Relief.

As well as directly raising money for the Comic Relief charity it will also help raise awareness of the tireless work that they do, not only on leading up to #RedNoseDay but throughout the year to help tackle poverty and social inequality in the UK and around the world.

Since the charity was formed in 1985 it has raised £950 million the help the above causes, with over 40% of that being spent directly on issues here in the UK.

Charity is an issue close to my heart and it always important to give something back. So much so that here at #TeamJigsaw we have set up our own charitable cause called <a title="Jigsaw Foundation" href="Since%20the launch of Jigsaw Medical, Chris has always believed in giving back and supporting charitable causes. Over the years Jigsaw and Chris personally have donated, supported and been involved in countless charitable activities across the country. The Jigsaw Foundation was set up to formalise our charitable aim and allow our team to decide on which charities the company wishes to support each year. We do this a number of ways, including by pledging to donate at least 1% of profits to charity." target="_blank">Jigsaw Foundation</a>, which was set up to formalise our charitable aim and allow our team to decide on which charities the company wishes to support each year. We do this a number of ways, including by pledging to donate at least 1% of profits to charity.

So if there are any other CEOs out there who haven't already done so. Get your smartphone, take a #CEOSelfie and upload it to the website...and don't forget to donate!!

<h3>After coming out of a meeting with one of my mentees last week it got me thinking about what makes a good mentor and what it means to me to be a mentor.</h3>
I was asked to become a Virgin Startup Mentor a couple of years ago and have thoroughly enjoyed every moment of it ever since. I love being able to make a real different to people's lives and their aspirations in business by providing them with support, guidance and encouragement, as well a few helpful tips that I have learnt along the way!

A good mentor relationship can be deeply rewarding for both parties involved as long as it is done properly. So what makes a good mentor?

The first key to becoming a good mentor is being genuinely interested in the person you're mentoring and to also believe in them personally and professionally. You need to make the effort to understand them and their business which will enable you to mentor them in a way that they need.

The relationship works both ways, therefore you must have credibility and have achieved some success in the area you are mentoring in otherwise the mentee will not trust your advice and feedback. I may be (quite) young but I like to think that with the things I have already achieved in business I can be seen as credible when mentoring young(er!) entrepreneurs.

This credibility will help you share your insights and experiences and ensure the mentee will take them aboard. Don't be afraid to share any mistakes or tough times you have had in the past; starting and running a business is never always easy-sailing (if you haven't had any downs yet they're unfortunately to come), however as long as you learn from mistakes and adversity you'll always come out the other side better, more determined and, dare-I-say-it, wiser!

Providing feedback and advice is a key part of being a mentor, but choosing the correct type of feedback and delivering at the right time is the challenging. Giving unwelcome feedback or unnecessary advice can be detrimental to morale and can affect the relationship with your mentee.

Finally, always remember to highlight any achievements that the mentee has made; celebrating their successes will help build their confidence and will make the relationship much stronger.

The most important thing to remember about being a mentor is the fact that every mentee and relationship is different; although the things above can be taken into consideration you have to be flexible and adapt to the person being mentored. Each situation will be different to the next but if done right there’s a lot of enjoyment that can come from watching someone develop and reach their full potential!

We all need mentors, I’m lucky enough to have very experienced and very inspirational mentors – without whom, Jigsaw would not be what it is today.

		<title>Why should you start your own business?</title>
		<link>http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/5-reasons-to-start-your-own-business/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[I started out in business at the tender (and slightly naive) age of 14 and have always wanted to run a business and achieve goals. I set about this whilst at University, which in hindsight probably wasnt the most sensible option but we all have to start somewhere, and decided to combine my passion for emergency medicine and creativity by forming Jigsaw Medical. I wouldn’t have it any other way, so I’ve decided to talk through my 5 top reasons for starting your own company…

1) <strong>Make your own decisions.</strong> I’m not one to make decisions without consulting my team, but I love having a direct impact on the culture and future of my company. This leads into my second reason…

2) <strong>Creativity</strong>. Having the ability to create our own opportunities and brand is amazing, our brand at Jigsaw Medical has become very recognisable and I’m very proud of how it has developed and become a sign of quality in the medical industry.

<a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/JMS-Logo-PNG1.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-770" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/JMS-Logo-PNG1.png" alt="JMS Logo (PNG)" width="1002" height="239" /></a>

<a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-08-at-10.32.52.png"><img class="aligncenter  wp-image-767" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Screen-Shot-2015-05-08-at-10.32.52.png" alt="jigsaw-branding" width="1002" height="657" /></a>

3) <strong>Doing what you enjoy</strong>. I work long hours but do it for something I’m passionate about it doesn’t feel like work (most of the time!). I imagine there is nothing worse than dreading going to work everyday and I am lucky enough not have to worry about that.

4) <strong>Picking my own team.</strong> I get to choose exactly who I want to work with. As I stated earlier we will always employ someone if we believe they can do a job for #TeamJigsaw, however I have to feel that they are willing to invest in the ethos of the company. As a result I like to think (and I hope our team would agree) that coming to work at Jigsaw House is enjoyable and not something you dread on a Sunday evening.

5) <strong>Being a mentor</strong>. As Jigsaw has grown and become more successful I was to be a mentor for <a title="Virgin Startup" href="http://www.virginstartup.org/" target="_blank">Virgin Startup</a> helping new entrepreneurs on their journey helping young entrepreneurs on their journey into owning their own business. If done right there’s a lot of enjoyment that can come from watching someone develop and reach their full potential!

6) Ok I said there was 5 but this one is important. <strong>Your reason.</strong> The list above details my reasons. if you’re reading this blog post you probably already have an interest in starting your own business. So, what is your reason? Share on social media and include your reason or comment below.

What are you waiting for?]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[The sun is shining and the UK events season is up and running. That means that event organisers all over the UK will be implementing those plans to execute an amazing event.

With Jigsaw Medical's recent appointment of Richard McManus as 'Head of Events', our capability and deliverabity has just got massive.

As you will always hear me say - "it's about the right people, in the right places" and Richard is no different, he joins #TeamJigsaw following a wide and varied career history. After serving in the Royal Navy for 7 years, he trained as an Aircraft Firefighter and medic serving in various destinations all over the world. Through this Richard become interested in pre-hospital medicine and on leaving the Navy joined the Yorkshire Ambulance Service and then North West Ambulance Service to complete his training.

As a Paramedic has been lucky enough to work on some of the UK's largest music events, sporting events and through this has developed a passion for event planning and medical management where he has been responsible for some of the UK's biggest events, such as V Festival. Richard particularly worked very closely with Jigsaw Medical last year as the primary link between the Tour de France and Jigsaw Medical teams and via this partnership a relationship developed which resulted in Richard taking on the 'Head of Events' position in the Jigsaw Medical clinical team.

Once again this is a great step for Jigsaw in our event provision and a further 7 appointments over as many weeks have equally developed other areas of the business.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Building Foundations &amp; Growing The Team</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/image2.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-796 size-medium" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/image2-e1436007648376-225x300.jpg" alt="image" width="225" height="300" /></a>Our head office team has grown 6-fold since the beginning of the year.</h2>
I am sat with Sammie this morning (with my very glamorous peppermint tea!), discussing the latest members of the Jigsaw team. Although Sammie remains adamant that she "can't keep up" with it all, I am proud to say that nearly 20 amazing people have joined our head office team in just 7 months. Joining them are over 100 ambulance clinicians working on our own ambulances and over 3,000 Nurses, Ambulance Clinicians, Paramedics and Doctors - all of which I am proud to say are part of #TeamJigsaw.

After an exceptional start to 2015, we announced last week the appointment of Julie Mercer as our new Projects and Compliance Director. Julie joins Jigsaw Medical as a vastly experienced Director particularly within Project and Compliance leadership, and as a former Nurse and Operational Director for NHS Professionals she was responsible for the design, set up and implementation of the current “NHSP” organisation commissioned by the Department Of Health becoming the largest ‘in-house’ national temporary staff provider of the NHS. Before joining Jigsaw, she worked for a £500million recruitment business in a similar role, so not only can she do an amazing job, she is able to do it on a huge scale (which is exactly where we are hoping to be).

Along with Julie, we have recently had a further 7 members of the team join our head office in as many weeks. Richard McManus (who I wrote about in my <a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/event-season-underway/">post on the event season</a>) – is a Paramedic and former Medical Manager for events such as ‘V Festival’ and the ‘Tour de France’, he joins as Head of Events and will be responsible for leading our team of event managers to deliver and develop medical provision to some of the UK’s largest events.

Jon Shield has been appointed to lead our Specialist Operations Division, which is an exciting new division that will be launching in August 2015. As well as recently completing his Paramedic Degree, Jon has extensive military background serving in the Parachute Regiment, and has also worked in the private sector on Close Protection, Maritime and hostile environment deployments across the globe.

Furthermore, Sian Jeffery and Elliot Finney have joined Jigsaw as Recruitment Consultants to facilitate the growth within our recruitment division, and deal with the increasing demands faced of an ever expanding client-base. Additionally, Elinor Parry has joined our Training Division to facilitate the range of additional courses we are offering this year. Jan Pomfret joins our compliance team from a position with the UK Doctor's regulator, the GMC. Finally, Lisa Walker joins our Accounts &amp; Payroll team to support the day-to-day finance requirements and the payroll of thousands of people every week.
<h3>It's about foundations...</h3>
I was recently honoured to be asked to speak at a recent event hosted by <a href="http://www.ukfast.co.uk">UKFast</a>. Lawrence Jones (CEO of UKFast) asked me to join him and two other entrepreneurs to share our experiences for their #InspireMCR event. One thing struck me during Lawrence's talk was one analogy which really hit home with me and the strategy we so strongly adopted at Jigsaw - which was "the stronger your foundations, the higher your building will be".

Up until recently, both our compliance and accounts teams had more people in than our sales teams in any of our divisions. We could have easily taken on loads of great sales people between the beginning of the year and now, but we didn't. The reason? - because we wanted our foundations to be strong enough to support our huge plans for the coming years.

You will notice that many of these recent appointments are very much 'sales' focused because now we have those very strong foundations in place, we can really start to make an even bigger dint on the market than we already have.

No longer is Jigsaw Medical simply the vision of a 23 year old graduate Paramedic. We have inspirational people who share this vision. Our foundations consist of the very best people, in all of the right places. From an ex-CEO of a £580million group to management trainers. From Chartered Accountants to Consultant Anaesthetists, from vastly experienced NHS compliance Directors to the very best recruitment consultants, sales team, PR professionals, clinical educators and operational and clinical management professionals.

All of this makes #TeamJigsaw very special... the rest of 2015 and going into 2016 is going to be an awesome experience for everyone who is on-board the Jigsaw rocket ship!

		<title>Everyone is talking about disruption</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2><a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/disruption-300x196.jpg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-799" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/disruption-300x196-300x196.jpg" alt="disruption-300x196" width="300" height="196" /></a>Everyone seems to be talking about 'disruption' at the moment, but what does it mean?</h2>
I've heard an increasing rumble about disruption over the last few months, in fact it was only a couple of weeks ago I looked into it properly, after I was told by our PR team at <a href="www.jigsawmedical.com">Jigsaw Medical</a> that Lawrence Jones (CEO at UKFast) had mentioned us in his speech at the "IOD Disruptor" conference in Manchester.

When I watched it back to make sure Lawrence was being nice about us (which I never doubted, for the record), there were some amazing 'takes' on disruption and how powerful it is in businesses, especially in this new world of huge technological capability and what seems to be a more enterprising culture than the past few years.

After a bit of digging, I noticed that Richard Branson had setup 'Virgin Disruptor's' with Holly (his daughter) which essentially debated areas of 'disruption' and focused on entrepreneurs being 'open minded' in order to become a 'disruptor'.

A <a href="http://www.forbes.com/sites/carolinehoward/2013/03/27/you-say-innovator-i-say-disruptor-whats-the-difference/">recent post by Forbes</a> claimed that people are sometimes confused about the difference between innovation and disruption. "It’s not exactly black and white, but there are real distinctions, and it’s not just splitting hairs." They said to "think of it this way: Disruptors are innovators, but not all innovators are disruptors — in the same way that a square is a rectangle but not all rectangles are squares"... (at this point, you have to stick with it).... Innovation and disruption are similar in that they are both makers and builders. Disruption takes a left turn by literally uprooting and changing how we think, behave, do business, learn and go about our day-to-day.
<h3>Do Jigsaw disrupt?</h3>
To be honest, I think we have done so since the beginning - without really knowing it. I'd like to say that we have started to change how private organisations within the healthcare sector operate and are perceived. Without going on forever, I can think of a few examples of how we have 'disrupted the market'. One example is being the only fully self-sufficient ambulance provider in the private sector, with the ability to educate internally right up to Paramedic degree level, including the relevant on-the-job training (the only company in that position). Another example would be to utilise Health Care Professionals in 'out of the box ways', such as putting Paramedics in operating theatres.

The vision for everyone in Jigsaw is big, it's to make a huge impact on the healthcare sector, with maximum quality healthcare in a creative and innovative way, embracing technology in the process.

That's the stamp we want to leave on the UK and eventually the world... so if that's what you call 'disruption' in the market, then I am proud to say we are 'disruptor's' (in the nicest possible way).]]></content:encoded>

You will often here this quote from entrepreneurs and it is certainly one I can relate to. Whilst everyone needs to earn a living, I like many entrepreneurs didn't start my business to "make lots of money" and in actual fact, I have never measured the success of Jigsaw in how much money we have been making, rather I use our level of revenue as a guide to see how we are growing.

Personally, I think a leader needs to be 'visionary' rather than exclusively money and performance focused, they need to see the 'bigger picture' and drive the 'purpose' of the business. I truly believe that if entrepreneurs hold this as a core value, the money will follow as a byproduct.
<h2>Does everyone need to forget about the money?</h2>
Absolutely not. Whilst it is vital for 'visionary' entrepreneurs to stay focused on the purpose and 'bigger picture', every business needs to make money to survive and in actual fact, they need the exact opposite to themselves in order to succeed.

Accountants clearly need to focus on the money, where it goes and make sure any business has enough of it to meet the vision of the leader - but this concept goes beyond them.

In Jigsaw, I would classify myself as 'visionary' rather than money focused, I would rather spend money on making Jigsaw better, than putting it in my personal bank account. However, without my money driven counter parts in our Sales and Recruitment teams - nothing would ever happen! Equally, we need the Clinical teams to be focused on quality, rather than money and so they are not afraid of getting the latest equipment. It is this blend which has got Jigsaw to where it is.
<h2>So is "Money is a byproduct of success"?</h2>
Absolutely. But only when you have the right blend of people, with their own reasons for doing what they are doing - which does actually include, in the likes of our recruitment &amp; sales teams, them being money focused.

		<title>Leadership - What makes a good leader?</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>With the Labour leadership campaign representing a large proportion of the national media coverage at the moment I thought it would be a good time to write an article about leadership.</h3>
Don't worry I'm not going to write an article about politics, and whilst I don't agree with Jeremy Corbyn on quite a few of his policies there does seem to be some distinct reasons as to why he is garnering so much support and momentum, and those reasons can be easily applied to leading in the work place.
<h3>1) Honesty</h3>
Whether it be business or politics, being open and honest is a key attribute of a good leader. Here at #TeamJigsaw I always do my best to be honest with all of my team, irrespective of their level in the 'hierarchy', about the performance and direction of the company. The team are a direct reflection of myself and the company so if I am honest and ethical with them, they will follow suit, and that will come across to clients and customers alike.
<h3>2) Communication</h3>
I am very clear what I want to achieve with Jigsaw and much of it is a shared vision of where we want to be. Ultimately that is to be the best supplier of medical staff and clinical / healthcare services in the world, whilst also providing the highest quality of care to our customer, clients and ultimately the patients. At #TeamJigsaw there are no secrets. All of the team know exactly what we want to achieve and having these defined goal helps us all work towards it with more confidence.
<h3>3) Passion</h3>
Like the above I am extremely passionate about Jigsaw Medical and the quality of care we provide, particularly to patients that our ambulance crews and medical staff deal with on a day-to-day basis. I'm not backwards in coming forwards in sharing and conveying my passion and what we want to achieve, and I think this helps other members of #TeamJigsaw buy into the ethos of the company. Well we've never had a member of staff leave so we must be doing something right!
<h3>4) Commitment</h3>
If you want people to work hard for you and your company you must put the work in yourself and lead by example. I'm usually one of the first in the office in the morning and one of the last out in the evening. I believe that people see my commitment to the cause and I like to think that this motivates people to do the same. Additionally, I am committed to making Jigsaw House and our other 5 offices an enjoyable place to come to everyday, which helps keep morale and motivation high within the company, and in turn helps people deliver the highest quality of work possible.
<h3>5) Optimism</h3>
This is possibly my favourite and the most important. A leader has to be optimistic. The best leaders in the world and particularly the ones who have inspired me (Richard Branson and Lawrence Jones) are some of the most optimistic people you will ever meet. They're always a source of positive energy and you can see a reflection of them in the staff that work for them. When there is a problem at Jigsaw I don't dwell on the problems but always try to provide a positive solution and find the right things to do to inspire and reassure.

Obviously there are countless other attributes that contribute to being a good leader, the above list is not the be all and end all. My team may tell you differently (I hope not!!) but I like to think I'm doing a good job at leading #TeamJigsaw in the right direction. However, there isn't one right answer, you have to be able to constantly learn and evolve, but if you're successful and your team support you, you're probably doing it right!]]></content:encoded>

This year, I am super proud to have been included in the <a href="http://www.insidermedia.com/insider/north-west/148763-insider-reveals-42-under-42-list/">class of 2015</a>, this is certainly testament to the efforts of the whole of #TeamJigsaw, both in our HQ, regional offices and of course the Paramedics, Doctors, Nurses and Ambulance Clinician's we have out treating patients across the UK.

Chris Maguire, editor of <em>North West Business Insider</em>, said: "These are the people who we feel are the ones to watch. The class of 2015 is packed full of inspirational entrepreneurs. Age has been no barrier to their success and we congratulate them all."

I am proud to be the youngest on the list this year, but the fact remains that it is not "me" who has secured a place on this prestigious list - I am simply accepting it on behalf of the whole of #TeamJigsaw who have got us to where we are today - so thank you!

		<title>Incredible 6 months at Jigsaw Medical!</title>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>2015 has been a special year for Jigsaw Medical but the final 6 months have been particularly impressive with multi-million-pound investment, life-saving treatment and unprecedented growth.</h3>
Since June, Jigsaw Medical have added over 30 brand new fully-kitted ambulances to the already expansive fleet as well as 8 brand new response vehicles that help supplement the ambulances clinically. In order to house the new vehicles, multiple operational offices have been established across the UK that act as bases for crew members to work from in a whole host of different areas.

As well as operational expansion, Jigsaw medical has always been a keen “Investor in People” and in the previous 6 months, the head office (Jigsaw House) in Tarporley has seen 8 new people successfully join the team with 2 new members set to join the New Year.

The last 6 months have also seen 2 new Directors join the company; Julie Mercer joined the team in late summer as Projects and Compliance Director. Julie joined Jigsaw Medical as a vastly experienced Director particularly within Project and Compliance leadership within the NHS. Additionally, Richard McManus was appointed Director of Clinical Services in July (after previously holding the Head of Events position) and brought with him a wealth of medical and event organisation experience.

Richard stated: “It’s been an eventful but ultimately extremely fruitful end to 2015. With over 600 clinicians successfully registering and becoming fully compliant in that period. Coupled with over £3 million invested in gold standard equipment and vehicles we have managed to amass in excess of 250,000 hours worked by the Jigsaw team.”

“And in that period, with the expertise, knowledge and equipment that our crews are armed with, as well as other key performance indicators, we have been responsible for 8 ROSCs (Return of Spontaneous Circulation) and the safe delivery of at least 5 babies. Without the incredible investment and team that we have at Jigsaw none of that would have been possible.”]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h3>As 2015 comes to a close, its time to reflect on the year that's passed and set goals for the year ahead...</h3>
For me, 2015 has been an incredible year - fast paced to say the least. In just one year we have grown over 500% on the previous year which is all thanks to our amazing team and of course our clients. 2015 has seen over 2,200 new clinicians registering to work with Jigsaw Medical, we have invested over £3 million in gold standard equipment and vehicles we have managed to amass in excess of 750,000 hours worked by the Jigsaw team... our Ambulance crews have even delivered over 10 babies into the world!

On a personal level, it has been amazing to continue to build our leadership team and see Jigsaw, in just 4 years, going from the University bedroom startup it once was, to a multi-million pound business.
<h4><a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/teamjigsaw.png"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-836" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/teamjigsaw-300x60.png" alt="teamjigsaw" width="300" height="60" /></a>My very own New Year's Honors List....</h4>
The 'Jigsaw Medical' we have today is only here because of the team and those who have helped me (and the business) along the journey so far, I would like to thank absolutely all of the team who are such a massive part of Jigsaw in their own ways and in their respective divisions....
<ul>
	<li>To the Directors who keep everything (including me) in check - I don't know what I would do without these amazing guys!</li>
	<li>The Jigsaw House; recruitment, compliance, finance, training, clinical, operations and communications teams</li>
	<li>To the Area Operations teams who keep our operational bases running smoothly 24/7</li>
	<li>Our Clinical Governance Team who make sure our patients get the very best clinical care</li>
	<li>Our Fleet Engineers who work 24/7 keeping our vehicles on the road</li>
	<li>... and of course; the Paramedics, Emergency Care Assistants, Technicians, Nurses and Doctors who represent Jigsaw and deliver this exceptional care to our patients... you are all amazing and without you, there would be no Jigsaw!</li>
</ul>
Along with our own team, I would like to thank our suppliers for keeping us well stocked in 2015 (specifically <a href="http://www.spservices.co.uk">SP Services</a>) and all those organisations who continue to support Jigsaw's growth. I would also like to thank all those who continue to support me personally through guidance, mentorship and support; including my family (Mum, Dad &amp; Sister, Rob, Laurie and of course Sammie!) and last but not least... <a href="http://www.lawrencejones.eu/">Lawrence Jones </a>for the mentorship, support, guidance and inspiration! - I cannot begin to tell you all how much of a difference this has made!
<h4><a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2016-new-year-ss-1920.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-835" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2015/12/2016-new-year-ss-1920-300x169.jpg" alt="2016-new-year-ss-1920" width="300" height="169" /></a>Into 2016...</h4>
We have some big - in fact, very big plans for 2016. Whilst I am so proud of growing over 500% this year, the plans for 2016 will see this be even higher compared with this year. However, as a fast growing business, we have learn't many lessons and we have had to adapt to demand and continue to improve, innovate and make things better - this is something we will continue as an ethos into 2016.

We have a continuous recruitment drive to support several new contracts starting in early 2016 and we hope to expand even more across the UK, particularly in strengthening our ambulance operations (so if you are reading this and fancy a new challenge in 2016, <a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/contact-chris/">get in touch</a>!). To further support this, we will build many more brand new, gold-standard vehicles for our crews to work with. Our clinical governance team will continue to drive clinical innovations and continue to hold our patients and the very forefront of what we do.
<h4>Tomorrow is the start of your 365 page book....</h4>
(When I posted this amazing quote on Twitter this morning, within 40seconds I was corrected... 2016 is of course a leap-year, so you actually get 366!!)

<h3 style="text-align: center;">What are your goals for 2016?... what is written in your book?</h3>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[Late last year I was honoured to be invited to be a participant in an annual event called MicroBizMattersDay. In a nutshell, MicroBizMattersDay is a global, annual day of actions. Everyone is asked to give at least 8 minutes, day or night, to make life better for micro enterprise (0-9 employees) owners everywhere.

<strong>Why I Support #MicroBizMattersDay...</strong>

I was very excited to be supporting #MicroBizMattersDay and it’s a cause that I am particularly passionate about. Having been introduced to Tony at an awards ceremony in 2014 I have closely followed Tony and Tina and #MicroBizMatters, and how it highlights the contribution independent business owners and self-employed people make, not only to the growth of this country’s economy but to the global economy.

Additionally, startups such as the company I own, Jigsaw Medical, contribute not only to the local economy by providing jobs and security for staff, we also provide a fantastic service to the general public through the provision of highly skilled staff and brand new, state-of-the-art equipment and ambulances.
<blockquote>
<p style="text-align: center;">Tony and Tina do a fantastic job advocating the importance of the small business and startups, again something that particularly resonates with myself.</p>
</blockquote>
When I launched my business back in 2012 I was lucky enough to have a lot of help and support from experienced people as well as some fantastic family and friends. But not everyone is lucky enough to have that, so as a result, I can’t wait for January 8th where hopefully I can impart some nuggets of wisdom and advice to other micro-businesses, whilst also gaining crucial advice and tips on different things I can do to help me run my businesses.

<strong>The Day</strong>

On the day, I took part in an hour-long webchat with other entrepreneurs and microbiz owners during the Enterprising Young People Hour and found the whole experience fantastic. Being able to impart some wisdom and pick up some tips for myself was exceptionally useful.

Check out the video of the web chat. I’m on from 1 hour 52 minutes if that’s what takes your fancy! (I'm sure it isnt...)

Overall it was a great day to be a part of and I hope to be involved next year.]]></content:encoded>

		<title>Jigsaw Sponsors The Virgin STRIVE Challenge 2016</title>
		<link>http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/supporting-virgin-strive-challenge/</link>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<strong>After providing medical support to the Virgin STRIVE Challenge in 2014, I am delighted that we have gone one step further for 2016 and will be one of the key sponsors of this year’s <a href="http://bigchange.strivechallenge.com">Virgin STRIVE Challenge</a>. </strong>

For those that don’t know about the challenge, it was set up in 2014 by Sam Branson and cousin Noah Devereux and involves a team of people testing themselves via a series of ultra-endurance challenges, all to raise funds for the charity, <a href="http://big-change.org">Big Change</a> which was founded in 2012 by Holly and Sam Branson, Princess Beatrice of York, Sam Richardson, Phil Nevin, and Isabella Branson. It's goal - to think differently about the role that charity can play in driving change for young people in the UK. The charity aims to do more than just treating symptoms, they wanted to positively move things forward, backing solutions that demonstrate alternative ways of supporting young people- helping them to thrive in life, not just in exams.

<a href="https://www.jigsawmedical.com/wp-content/uploads/MG_7716.jpg"><img class="wp-image-6125 aligncenter" src="https://www.jigsawmedical.com/wp-content/uploads/MG_7716.jpg" alt="virgin-strive-bigchange-2016" width="800" height="533" /></a>

In 2014, we provided the ambulances, medical staff, and equipment, whilst a 10-strong team hiked, ran, rowed, cycled climbed from London to the summit of the Matterhorn in Switzerland. The 2016 challenge picks up where the 2014 challenge ended and sees a team of 25 tackle a punishing 30-day journey from the base of the Matterhorn to Mount Etna in Sicily, all whilst being looked after by #TeamJigsaw’s expert team of Doctors, Paramedics, Ambulances and Physiotherapists.

I am so proud to see Jigsaw supporting this amazing charity!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>This morning I shared a quote on social media which I stumbled across on the internet. The author is unknown, but the words absolutely hit the nail on the head...</h2>
<a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_5802.jpg"><img class="alignright wp-image-868 size-medium" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_5802-300x225.jpg" alt="IMG_5802" width="300" height="225" /></a>

In the midst of a huge time for Jigsaw, with the upcoming launch of our new Non-Emergency Patient Transport division and some exciting new developments in all of our existing divisions, we are certainly turning our dreams, into plans.

A quote on my current office wall (I say current, as we've outgrown our current head office and are planning a move! - but more on that soon) says; "if you can dream it, you can do it" - Walt Disney. I look at this every day and it reminds me that "can't" just means either nobody has said yes yet, or nobody has done it before!

This quote is also very apt as in a couple of weeks time, I fly out to Zermatt in Switzerland to see of the <a href="http://bigchange.strivechallenge.com">Virgin STRIVE Challenge</a> team - they will certainly need to turn their can'ts into cans!

Happy Tuesday!]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[A-Level results day is a stressful time for those who are banking on their results in order to secure competitive places on university courses. But if you've not done as well as you would have liked, the world is not over...

<a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_5625.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-873" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/08/IMG_5625-300x300.jpg" alt="IMG_5625" width="300" height="300" /></a>

In actual fact; Richard Branson, Deborah Meaden, Jeremy Clarkson and my good friend Lawrence Jones are examples of successful people who didn't make the grade in their A-Levels - but appear on the rich list nonetheless.

My own experience at A-Level was less than glamorous, I passed (just) and didn't manage to secure a place at University in the same year. In fact, I wasn't keen on the idea of university, but had no choice if I wanted to reach my goal of becoming a Paramedic. I battled on and managed to secure a place at Oxford Brookes University the year after, using my 'work experience' (gained during my 'year out', in place of the grades they required (as I didn't have the grades, or subjects, they asked for)... So grades are not everything.

Grades do not define you, they do not make decisions for you, they are merely an objective test of a small part of what matters in life. Since going to Oxford Brookes (with the wrong A-Levels) and graduating with Distinction, I am now extremely proud to be one of their '<a href="https://www.brookesalumni.co.uk/new-responsive-design---february-2014/responsive-pages/alumni-profiles/new-responsive-design---alumni-profiles---chris-percival">Notable Alumni</a>'!

Congratulations to those of you who have got the grades you wanted... but if you've not got the grades you wanted. Don't worry. You can do whatever you want to do, you can be whoever you want to be. A couple of exams do not define this and there are multiple routes to your goals.]]></content:encoded>

		<content:encoded><![CDATA[<h2>As a very proud sponsor of the Virgin STRIVE Challenge 2016, I flew to Swizerland (more specifically, Zermatt) for the launch of this amazing challenge...</h2>
Zermatt itself is an amazing place, with stunning views of the Matterhorn, where some of you may remember we ended the 2014 Challenge (with a little bit of drama, with <a href="https://www.virgin.com/richard-branson/watch-the-virgin-strive-challenge-rescue-off-the-matterhorn">Sam Branson being rescued from the summit of the Matterhorn</a>!). The 2016 challenge sets off from where the 2014 challenge finished and heads over to Sicily entirely under human power, including; hiking, cycling, swimming and finally a half-marathon up Mount Etna (you can see the full route <a href="http://bigchange.strivechallenge.com/the-route/">here</a>).

<a href="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Unknown-1.jpeg"><img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-879" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/Unknown-1-300x300.jpeg" alt="unknown-1" width="300" height="300" /></a>This incredible challenge is tough for those joining it for even a stage (in total, there are 5 stages), but the core team are doing the whole thing, from start to finish! When Noah and Sam talked to the very pumped up crowd on the first evening we were in Zermatt, they made clear that STRIVEing was not about competitiveness, it was about joining forces, being a team and getting there together (in one piece!).

The amazing Karl Lokko summed it up, comparing his past where gangs were always bad things, to the Strive gang being one positive way of striving for change. One thing that really struck me throughout the first week for the challenge was just how supportive each and every striver was for their fellow team mates - it was amazing to see. One evening Richard Branson returned to one remote hut to join the rest of the team, in the dark (accompanied by one of the Jigsaw medical team and a guide) - only to be met by a standing ovation by his fellow strivers who had left the dinner table to see him back safely!! - this is what it's all about.

I am proud that Jigsaw is sponsoring such an fantastic event, for a fantastic cause, as well as providing a comprehensive ambulance, medical and physiotherapy team for the entire event.

<img class="alignright size-medium wp-image-891" src="http://www.chrispercival.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2017/01/15400984_10154247540328262_8689973001302486932_n-1-300x225.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="225" />

As you may have read, we were proud to have sponsored the <a href="http://bigchange.strivechallenge.com/">Virgin STRIVE Challenge</a> in 2016, raising an incredible seven-figure sum for the charity '<a href="http://big-change.org/">Big Change</a>'. As a provider of medical services and one of the key sponsors, I was pleased to welcome Sam &amp; Noah to Jigsaw House, to introduce them to the team and hear about what has been happening since the epic challenge and where the huge amount of money raised will be going.

Noah spoke to the team about 'growth mindset' and the purpose of the philosophy and we also heard from Jan (our Head of Compliance, who took part in one of the cycle legs) who although told Sam and I beforehand that she was very nervous and hated public speaking - did an incredible job (so much so, we couldn't get her off the stage - so well done Jan!). Then we heard from Kathryn, who coordinated our medical team for the STRIVE challenge, who spoke about working together as a team to look after the participants and help make the event what it was.

We had a great day hearing about the incredible cause we have all worked so far to raise such a huge amount of money for and I am very much looking forward to what Sam &amp; Noah think up for the next challenge!]]></content:encoded>
