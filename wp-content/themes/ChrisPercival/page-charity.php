		<h1>The Pledge</h1>
		<p class="p-charity">Since the launch of Jigsaw Medical, Chris has always believed in giving back and supporting charitable causes. Over the years Jigsaw and Chris personally have donated, supported and been involved in countless charitable activities across the country. The Jigsaw Foundation was set up to formalise our charitable aim and allow our team to decide on which charities the company wishes to support each year. We do this a number of ways, including by pledging to donate at least 1% of profits to charity.</p>
